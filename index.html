          <h5 class="card-title">Research</h5>
          <p class="card-text">We conducted user interviews using Zoom and a google survey to get qualitative and quantitative data to best understand who our ideal user was. The interview questions and objectives were based on an initial proto-persona as a way to gain insight into what types of questions and conversations we should be having in interviews. The google survey was a sure way to an overall understanding of what typical users look for when deciding where to go to get a cocktail. The survey results were then synthesized with the interviews to understand the opportunities present for problems that people have. Following the interviews, a number of interviews raised questions about the competitors in the market, which lead us to ask questions about potential holes that the Chaser App could fill.</p>

          <p class="lead">The Chaser App was designed to achieve an easier way for people to find new bars and cocktails to try. From our user research, current apps don't allow for people to easily find their coktail of choice and tailor their social life to it. How might we create an app that helps to curate an experience that users want to enjoy with others?.</p>

          <p class="card-text"> We thought of different features through the "I like, I wish, What if" method to come up with possible ideas for the app. Since we knew who the person using this app was, as well as the competitor opportunities, we created a feature list that then got ranked for the initial design of the app.</p>
